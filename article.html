                            <p>
                                Record keeping is essential in every aspect of our lives, including education, business, non governmental organisation, religion, government sector, military, etc. It can't be overwhelmed at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If one doesnst keep records of his/her activities and experiences, theress tendency that one won't be able to remember all activities done daily, talk less of overall activities done in a week or month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thatss why people in different profession fields, academic fields, non governmental organisation and governments keep records of everything that happened daily irrespective of the time, when, and how.

                                Major benefits of record keeping are using datass to solve problems, ability to reference to past transactions, inventories, etc.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Success requires good record keeping.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When one fails to keep records of what causes him/her to fail or lose, theress 90% chances that such person will fall into a similar situation. When one wins, then didn't analyse records he/she keeps, there's a chance that such person won't win in the
                                next event.
                            </p>

                                Be consistent with record keeping.

                                I will tell a story about how I derived the topic of this write-up. Let's analyse this together.
                                <p>
                                    <p>
                                        ------------
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Yesterday, I run a test on my typing skill speed which led me to discover the merit and demerit of making mistakes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While, testing my typing skill speed along with the ability to type without looking at the keyboard keys.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I did a mistake by pressing a wrong key, instead of pressing key “E” I pressed key “I”.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A single mistake led to occurrence of more mistakes, which caused my typing accuracy to reduce from 100% to 96%.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then, I tried again. This time around I focused more on ability to type without viewing the keys on the keyboard rather than focusing on my speed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That made me to concentrate on testing my typing skill proficiency. After some minutes, I mistakenly press key “E” instead of key “L”. This time around, I didn't let the mistake lead to occurrence of more mistakes because I focused more on building the
                                        ability to type without gazing at the keyboard while entering data's or typing a report rather than viewing the screen to sight errors such as punctuation mark, misspelt words, etc.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        ------------

                                    <p>
                                        First mistake will cause second mistake - second mistake will cause third mistake - third mistake will cause fourth mistake. The chain of mistake leading to another mistake will continue until there's a turn.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>
                                            <i>
                                                A turn could be change of focus, change of plan, redefining objectives of what to achieve in specific period of time, etc.
                                            </i>
                                        </b>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I switched my focus from “testing my typing skill speed” to “ability to type without gazing at the keyboard keys. Not changing my focus point will rather me not to consider paying attention to keys to press next, but focusing on building the ability to
                                        type without looking at the keyboard will increase my speed and concentration level.
